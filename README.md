### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

**paulgrunt/paulgrunt** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because I'm learning to become a Full Stack developer and I'm currently learning Git/GitHub. I'm so excited to be learning so much every day!

Here are some of my current status updates:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on growing my programming knowledge, and product design skills.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript/Git/GitHub/GitKraken, and then I'm branching into learning React, API's, Node, npm, Mongodb, Next, Typscript, MaterialUI, Redux, Electron, Jest, Netlify, Vercel, Firebase, Solidity, Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures. That's my learning branch... also taking CS50x.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects where I can contribute to the lifecycle of great software.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting a great FullStack development job in Denver, CO or remote.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you want, and if I can help I will.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I'm building out my personal site at http://www.paulgrunt.com or if you're in a hurry just DM me on most social platforms.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love bikes! I've been an avid cyclist my entire life. I've worked in the bike industry in many roles. I ride all the bikes, but my main focus is on road racing.
