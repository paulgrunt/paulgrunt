### Hello World! 👋

**paulgrunt/paulgrunt** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because I'm learning to become a Full Stack developer and I'm currently learning Git/GitHub. I'm so excited to be learning so much every day!

Here are some of my current status updates:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on learning to program, and product design for several applications I want to develop as portfolio projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript, and then I'm branching into learning react, api's, node, npm, mongodb, next, typscript, MaterialUI, Redux, Electron, Jest, Netlify, Vercel, Firebase, and Solidity. That's my learning branch.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on finding a FullStack developer job.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with getting my first development job.
- 💬 Ask me about anything you want, and if I can help I will.
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm building out my personal site at http://www.paulgrunt.com and all my contact info will be there... or search for me!
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love bikes! I'm an avid cyclist and I ride all the bikes with a focus on road racing.
